			<p>At Apptopia, we all come to work every day because we want to solve the biggest problem in mobile. Everyone is guessing. Publishers don’t know what apps to build, how to monetize them, or even what to price them at. Advertisers & brands don’t know where their target users are, how to reach them, or even how much they need to spend in order to do so. Investors aren’t sure which apps and genres are growing the quickest, and where users are really spending their time (and money). </p>
